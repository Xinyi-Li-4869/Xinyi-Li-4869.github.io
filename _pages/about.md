I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences (CMS) at Caltech, advised by Prof. Anima Anandkumar. 

I graduated from the School of the Gifted Young at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) with a major in mathematics. 

My research interests lie in developing spectral methods for complex geometries and chaotic fields. Feel free to reach out at xinyili@caltech.edu.
